This repository contains an R Shiny application that simulates the compound Poisson process defined as:

S(t) = X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xₙ(t)

where:

N(t) is a Poisson process with rate λ
Xᵢ are i.i.d. exponential random variables with rate μ
N(t) and Xᵢ are independent
The application enables interactive experimentation with parameter values, visual analysis of distributions, numerical summarization, and downloadable outputs.

Mathematical Derivation
1. Distribution of N(t)
If interarrival times are exponentially distributed with rate λ, the resulting counting process follows:

N(t) ~ Poisson(λt)

Thus:

P(N(t)=n) = exp(-λt) · (λt)ⁿ / n!

2. Conditional Distribution of S(t)
Given N(t)=n events occur up to time t:

S(t) = X₁ + X₂ + ... + Xn

Since each Xᵢ ~ Exponential(μ), their sum is Gamma distributed:

S(t) | N(t)=n ~ Gamma(shape = n, rate = μ)

Its density is:

f(s|n) = μⁿ sⁿ⁻¹ exp(-μs) / (n-1)! for s>0

3. Unconditional Distribution of S(t)
Since N(t) is random, S(t) is a Poisson mixture of Gamma distributions.

P(S(t)=0) = P(N(t)=0) = exp(-λt)

For s>0:

f(s) = Σ (exp(-λt) (λt)ⁿ/n!) [μⁿ sⁿ⁻¹ exp(-μs)/(n-1)!], summed over n≥1

Closed form exists but numerical simulation provides more intuitive insight.

4. Moments
E[N(t)] = λt
E[S(t)] = (λt)/μ
Var(S(t)) = (2λt)/μ²

These theoretical values are shown in the application alongside empirical simulation results.

Insights from Simulation
Parameter Change	Observed Effect
Increasing λ	More arrival events → larger cumulative value of S(t)
Increasing μ	Faster decay of exponential jumps → decreases S(t)
Increasing t	Both mean and spread of S(t) increase
Small λt	Right-skewed, often with mass near zero
Large λt	Distribution becomes smoother, closer to normality (CLT behaviour)
Key takeaway:
S(t) behaves like the total accumulated jump size over time. Larger λ or t increases accumulation frequency; μ determines individual jump size.
